# Neural-Network-from-scratch-using-Numpy
This repository contains a custom implementation of a neural network using NumPy. The neural network is built from scratch and allows for flexible configurations including the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, and learning rate.

## Features

- **Customizable Architecture**: You can specify the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer when creating the neural network.
- **Activation Functions**: Used Relu as it is simple and easy to understand.
- **Gradient Descent**: Implements gradient descent for training the network.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to include additional features or customizations.


## How to Run
- Clone or download this repository and just run the jupyter notbook file
